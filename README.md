# Juliar for Android

Juliar for Android is an open source Android App that allows you to run and execute Juliar
scripts from your Android phone or tablet. This project is a wrapper juliarlib.jar which is
built from the main Juliar repo. If you would like to create apps using Juliar or 
would like to use Juliar libraries in Android, juliarlib.jar is the place to start.

### Getting Started
Launch the App and begin by typing `function main() = { printLine("Hello");}` and clicking execute button.
A new entry will appear that will tell you the command you entered, the time the command was executed,
and the output. 

If you want to delete the entry just swipe left on it.

If you made a mistake or don't want to type the command again, just click on the underlined input text
and the input will be automatically populated.

### Supported commands
Juliar Android App is a wrapper around Juliar language, so code should work the same.
If something is not working, please post the issues in the issues section of the repository.



### Building from Source
Download the latest Android Studio.
From Android studio, run the Gradle script and launch the app.
